# IP-Geolocator
Automation script that combines multiple online IP Geolocation services like:

1. ipinfo.io
2. ipapi.co
3. api.ipdata.co
4. extreme-ip-lookup.com
5. Whois

Created to use the maximum number of free IP information requests provided by these services. It does this by automatically switching to the next service once all the requests from one service have been exhausted (typically 1000 requests/day).
